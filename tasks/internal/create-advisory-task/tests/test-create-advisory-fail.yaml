  description: |
    Run the create-advisory task and have it fail. Because that task doesn't use a workspace and the task always
    succeeds (due to how the internal tasks work), the only real way to check this is to examine the result and
    advisory_url task results. So, any failure will show itself in the same way, so this is the only failing
    unit test.

    The failure here is due to the `origin` param being `failing-tenant`, which is accounted for in mocks.sh
