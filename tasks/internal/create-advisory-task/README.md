# create-advisory-task

Pushes an advisory yaml to a Git repository. The task will always exit 0 even if something fails. This is because the task result
will not be set if the task fails, and the task result should always be set and propagated back to the cluster that creates the
internal request. The success/failure is handled in the task creating the internal request.
