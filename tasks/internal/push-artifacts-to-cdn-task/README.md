## Changes in 2.1.1
* Use /tmp for ssh data. In the app sre environment, we didn't have permissions to write to /root

## Changes in 2.1.0
* Added compute resource limits

## Changes in 2.0.0
* Add new required parameter `signingKeyName`. This is used for checksum signing

## Changes in 1.0.1
* Base64 decode keytab used for interacting with the checksum signing host (ETERA)

## Changes in 1.0.0
* Add steps for signing: `push-unsigned-using-oras`, `sign-mac-binaries`, `sign-windows-binaries`, `generate-checksums`
  * The code was copied and adapted from the `sign-binaries` managed task
  * New parameters were added to support signing, many of which have a default which is normally used

## Changes in 0.1.0
* Split out the extracting of the artifacts (via oras pull) to a separate step
