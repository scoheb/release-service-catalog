# publish-pyxis-repository

Tekton task to mark all repositories in the mapped snapshot as published in Pyxis.
This is currently only meant to be used in the rh-push-to-registry-redhat-io
and rh-advisories pipelines,
so it will convert the values to the ones used for registry.redhat.io releases.
E.g. repository "quay.io/redhat-prod/my-product----my-image" will be converted to use
registry "registry.access.redhat.com" and repository "my-product/my-image" to identify
the right Container Registry object in Pyxis. The task also optionally
marks the repositories as source_container_image_enabled true if pushSourceContainer
is true in the data JSON.
Additionally, this task respects the `publish-on-push` flag. If `false`, then the task
does not publish the repository.

The task emits a result: `signRegistryAccessPath`

This contains the relative path in the workspace to a text file that contains a list of repositories
that needs registry.access.redhat.com image references to be signed (i.e.
requires_terms=true), one repository string per line, e.g. "rhtas/cosign-rhel9".

Note: This task runs quite early on in the pipeline, because we need the result it produces
for the signing tasks (and `rh-sign-image` runs quite early to begin with). So this means
that if you're releasing to a repo for the first time, the repository might get published
even before the actual image is pushed and published. But we checked with RHEC team and this
shouldn't cause any problems, because RHEC will ignore repos with no published images.
