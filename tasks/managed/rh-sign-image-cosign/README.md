## Changes in 2.0.0
* This task now supports Trusted artifacts

## Changes in 1.4.0
* fix to ensure that the auth file used by cosign contains credentials for the registry

## Changes in 1.3.0
* Containers are signed only if the signature doesn't exist in the destination image
* Existing signature validation and signing are done in parallel now controlled by concurrencyLimit paremeter

## Changes in 1.2.1
* fix linting issues

## Changes in 1.2.0
* Retry failed cosign

## Changes in 1.1.0
* Bump release-service-utils to upgrade cosign version to 2.4.0 which includes the fix of an issue the osci team is having when trying to release.

## Changes in 1.0.0
* Added mandatory parameter `signRegistryAccessPath`.
  * The relative path in the workspace to a text file that contains a list of repositories
    that needs registry.access.redhat.com image references to be signed (i.e.
    requires_terms=true), one repository string per line, e.g. "rhtas/cosign-rhel9".
  * Only components for which the repository is included in the file will get
    the registry.access.redhat.com references signed.
* `skopeo inspect` call is now done on the source image (`containerImage` in snapshot), rather
  than on the target location (`repository` in mapped snapshot). This puts it in line
  with what's done in `rh-sign-image`, but also, we might want to sign the images before
  they're actually pushed.

## Changes in 0.3.0
* Make rekor url configurable

## Changes in 0.2.0
* Identity passed to cosign uses tags mentioned in .tags in the Snapshot instead of digests
