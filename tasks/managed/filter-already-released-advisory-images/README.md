# Filter Already Released Advisory Images

This task filters out images from a snapshot that have already been published in advisories.
It is a **managed Tekton task** that triggers an **internal task** using an InternalRequest,
and overwrites the mapped snapshot file with a filtered version containing only **unpublished images**.

The task also outputs a `skip_release` result, which is set to `true`
if all components are already released (and the pipeline can be skipped), or `false` otherwise.

The task overwrites the original mapped snapshot file in place with a filtered version containing only unpublished images. Downstream tasks continue to use the same snapshot path.
