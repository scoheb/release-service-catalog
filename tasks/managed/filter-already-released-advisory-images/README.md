# filter-already-released-advisory-images

This task filters out images from a snapshot that have already been published
in advisories. It is a **managed Tekton task** that triggers an **internal task**
using an InternalRequest, and overwrites the mapped snapshot file with a
filtered version containing only **unpublished images**.

The task also outputs a `skip_release` result, which is set to `true`
if all components are already released (and the pipeline can be skipped),
or `false` otherwise.

The task overwrites the original mapped snapshot file in place with a
filtered version containing only unpublished images.
Downstream tasks continue to use the same snapshot path.
