# collect-data

Tekton task to collect the information added to the data field of the release resources.

The purpose of this task is to collect all the data and supply it to the other task in the pipeline by creating
a json file called `data.json` in the workspace.

This task also stores the passed resources as json files in a workspace.

The parameters to this task are lowercase instead of camelCase because they are passed from the operator, and the
operator passes them as lowercase.

A task result is returned for each resource with the relative path to the stored JSON for it in the workspace.

Finally, the task checks that the keys from the correct resource (a key that should come from the
ReleasePlanAdmission should not be present in the Release data section).
