# create-advisory

Tekton task to create an advisory via an InternalRequest. The advisory data is pulled from the data JSON. The origin
workspace from the ReleasePlanAdmission and Application from the Snapshot are also used. The advisory is created in
a GitLab repository. Which repository to use is determined by the contents on the mapped repositories.
Only all `redhat-pending` or all `redhat-prod` repositories may be specified in `.data.mapping`
