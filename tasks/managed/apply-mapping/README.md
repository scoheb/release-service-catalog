# apply-mapping

Tekton task to apply a mapping to a Snapshot.

The purpose of this task is to merge a mapping with the components contained in a Snapshot.
The mapping is expected to be present in the data field of the ReleasePlanAdmission provided in
the `releasePlanAdmissionPath`. If the data field does not contain a `mapping` key, the original
Snapshot is returned. If there is a `mapping` key, it is merged with the `components` key in the
Snapshot based on component name.

A `mapped` result is also returned from this task containing a simple true/false value that is
meant to inform whether a mapped Snapshot is being returned or the original one.

This task supports variable expansion in tag values from the mapping. The currently supported variables are:
* "{{ timestamp }}" -> The build-date label from the image in the format provided by timestampFormat or %s as the
  default.
  If the build-date label is not available, we use the Created field in the image metadata as a fallback.
* "{{ release_timestamp }}" -> The current time in the format provided by timestampFormat or %s as the default
* "{{ git_sha }}" -> The git sha that triggered the snapshot being processed
* "{{ git_short_sha }}" -> The git sha reduced to 7 characters
* "{{ digest_sha }}" -> The image digest of the respective component
* "{{ incrementer }}" -> Automatically finds the highest existing incremented tag in the
  repository and generates the next sequential tag (e.g., if the highest tag is v1.0.0-2, it will generate v1.0.0-3)

You can also expand image labels, e.g. "{{ labels.mylabel }}" -> The value of image label "mylabel"
