# check-data-keys

Tekton task that validates data keys against a schema to ensure that all required keys for a system(s) are present
and correctly formatted. The system(s) passed into the `systems` parameter become required.
The schema validation also applies to all data passed into the `dataPath` parameter,
meaning all the data keys must be allowed and formatted correctly.

For example, if `releaseNotes` is passed as a system and the data file does not have all the required
releaseNotes keys, the schema will give validation errors, and the task will fail.

Currently, `releaseNotes`, and `cdn` are the only supported systems.
