## Signing data parameters

 The signing configuration should be set as `data.sign` in the _releasePlanAdmission_. The data should be set in the _ReleasePlanAdmission_ as follows:

```
data:
    sign:
        pipelineImage: <image pullspec>
        configMapName: <configmap name>
```

## Changes in 3.0.0
* This task now supports Trusted artifacts

## Changes in 2.6.0
* Added compute resource limits

## Changes in 2.5.2
* Undo changes introduced in 2.5.1
  * Early failure prevents pasting of internal pipelineRun or taskRun

## Changes in 2.5.1
* Improve logging of `internal-request`
  * Previously we would just swallow the output and if it failed for any reason, the log wouldn't have anything useful

## Changes in 2.5.0
* The pipeline is called via git resolver now instead of cluster resolver
  * This was done by changing from `-r` to `--pipeline` in the `internal-request` call
  * The base image was updated to include this new functionality
  * New parameters `taskGitUrl` and `taskGitRevision` added to enable the git resolver

## Changes in 2.4.2
* Use a temp file for `internal-request` result instead of a fixed file in the workspace to reduce risk
  of interference with other tasks

## Changes in 2.4.1
* Fix shellcheck/checkton linting issues in the task and tests

## Changes in 2.4.0
* No longer examine `.data.sign.request` to obtain the Signing pipeline name. Use the default - blob-signing-pipeline

## Changes in 2.3.0
* Updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 2.2.0
* Updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 2.1.0
* remove `dataPath` default value

## Changes in 2.0.0
* The internalrequest CR is created with a label specifying the pipelinerun uid with the new pipelineRunUid parameter
  - This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 1.0.2
* Save the `.sig` file as a non-ASCII armored GPG binary instead of clear ASCII GPG signature

## Changes in 1.0.1
* Now the task decodes the payload from base64 before creating the `.sig` file
