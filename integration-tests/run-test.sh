# run-test.sh - Main orchestrator for end-to-end release catalog pipeline testing.
#
# Overview:
#   This script executes a specific test suite for a release pipeline.
#   It simulates a complete workflow, including environment setup, secret
#   decryption, GitHub interactions (branching, PRs), Kubernetes resource
#   management (namespaces, CRs using kustomize/envsubst), monitoring of
#   Konflux Components and Tekton PipelineRuns, and finally, verification
#   of the Release custom resource.
#
#   The script is designed to be generic, with suite-specific configurations
#   and test logic loaded from a specified suite directory.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-test.sh <suite_name> [options]
#
# Arguments:
#   <suite_name>          : (Required) The name of the test suite to execute.
#                           This corresponds to a subdirectory under the script's
#                           own directory (e.g., if script is in 'integration-tests',
#                           suite 'fbc-release' would be in 'integration-tests/fbc-release').
#                           This suite directory must contain:
#                             - test.env: Environment variables for the suite.
#                             - test.sh: Suite-specific test logic and functions.
#
# Options:
#   -sc, --skip-cleanup   : If set, the script will not perform cleanup operations
#                           (GitHub branches, Kubernetes resources) on exit.
#   -nocve, --no-cve      : If set, the script will not simulate the addition of a CVE.
#                           This affects commit messages and expected CVE data during
#                           release verification. Defaults to including CVE data.
#
# Environment Variables (Expected):
#   The script sources suite-specific environment variables from
#   `${SCRIPT_DIR}/<suite_name>/test.env`.
#   Key variables typically include (but are not limited to):
#     Required by the framework or common functions:
#       GITHUB_TOKEN                  - GitHub Personal Access Token.
#       VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE           - Path to Ansible Vault password file.
#       RELEASE_CATALOG_GIT_URL       - Git URL for the release service catalog.
#       RELEASE_CATALOG_GIT_REVISION  - Git revision for the release service catalog.
#     Required by specific test suites (examples):
#       component_branch              - Name of the component branch to create.
#       component_base_branch         - Base branch for the component branch.
#       component_repo_name           - GitHub repository name (e.g., "owner/repo").
#       managed_namespace             - Kubernetes namespace for managed resources.
#       tenant_namespace              - Kubernetes namespace for tenant resources (incl. Release CR).
#       application_name              - AppStudio Application name.
#       component_name                - AppStudio Component name.
#       managed_sa_name               - ServiceAccount in managed namespace (for advisory fetching).
#   Optional (globally recognized):
#     KUBECONFIG                    - Path to the Kubernetes configuration file.
#
# Dependencies:
#   External Commands:
#     - ansible-vault, kubectl, kustomize, envsubst, curl, jq, oc, tkn, yq, mktemp
#   Sourced Scripts (paths relative to this script's location):
#     - `<suite_name>/test.env`     : Suite-specific environment variables.
#                                     (Resolved to: ${SCRIPT_DIR}/<suite_name>/test.env)
#     - `<suite_name>/test.sh`      : Suite-specific test logic and functions.
#                                     (Resolved to: ${SCRIPT_DIR}/<suite_name>/test.sh)
#     - `lib/test-functions.sh`     : Common library functions for testing.
#                                     (Resolved to: ${SCRIPT_DIR}/lib/test-functions.sh)
#   Helper Scripts (typically called by functions in sourced scripts):
#     - Located in `../scripts/` relative to this script's directory.
#       (e.g., delete-single-branch.sh, create-branch-from-base.sh,
#        wait-for-release.sh, get-advisory-content.sh, etc.).
#
# Exit Behavior:
#   - Exits 0 on successful completion of all steps and verifications.
#   - Exits with a non-zero status code on error.
#   - A trap is set to call the 'cleanup_resources' function on EXIT,
#     regardless of success or failure (unless --skip-cleanup is used).
#     The cleanup function receives the exit code, line number, and command.
