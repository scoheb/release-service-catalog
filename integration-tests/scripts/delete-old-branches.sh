# Delete Old GitHub Branches
# ========================
#
# Summary:
# --------
# This script automatically cleans up old branches in a GitHub repository by
# deleting branches that haven't had any commits within a specified timeframe.
# It only considers branches that start with a specified prefix.
# It skips branches ending in "-base" and the "main" branch for safety.
#
# Branch deletion logic:
# - Branches with commits after creation: deleted if last commit is older than cutoff
# - Branches with no commits after creation: deleted only if branch is older than 2 days
#
# Features:
# --------
# - Identifies branches with no recent commits
# - Configurable cutoff period (default: 1 day)
# - Safe deletion with base branch protection
# - Branch prefix filtering to target specific branch types
# - Smart branch deletion: preserves new branches without commits, removes old unused branches
# - Handles pagination for repositories with many branches
# - Provides detailed output of deleted branches
#
# Usage:
# -----
#   ./delete-old-branches.sh <owner/repository> <branch_prefix>
#
# Example:
#   ./delete-old-branches.sh redhat/release-service e2e-test
#   ./delete-old-branches.sh konflux-ci/release-service-catalog integration-test
#
# Required Environment Variables:
# ----------------------------
# - GITHUB_TOKEN: GitHub Personal Access Token with repo access
#
# Configuration:
# -------------
# - CUTOFF_DATE: Time period to consider a branch as old (default: "1 day")
# - Automatically skips branches:
#   * Ending in "-base"
#   * Named "main"
#
# GitHub API Details:
# -----------------
# - Uses GitHub REST API v2022-11-28
# - Requires 'repo' scope permissions
# - Handles up to 100 branches per page
#
# Exit Codes:
# ----------
# - 0: Success
# - 1: Error (missing token, invalid repo, API error)
