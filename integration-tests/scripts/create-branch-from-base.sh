# Summary:
#   Creates a new branch in a GitHub repository based on the latest commit of
#   an existing base branch.
#
# Parameters:
#   $1: repo_name         - The name of the GitHub repository (e.g., "owner/repo").
#   $2: base_branch_name  - The name of the existing branch from which to create
#                           the new branch.
#   $3: new_branch_name   - The name for the new branch to be created.
#
# Environment Variables:
#   GITHUB_TOKEN        - A GitHub personal access token with permissions to read
#                         refs and create branches in the repository. Required.
