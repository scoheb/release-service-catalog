# simple-signing pipeline

Tekton pipeline for simple signing. It is meant to be used by the rh-sign-image task, not as a standalone managed pipeline.

## Changes in 0.3.0
* Update all task pathInRepo values as they are now in `tasks/internal`

## Changes in 0.2.0
* Changed the results used as parameters to `request-and-upload-signature`
  * Instead of using the same results for both the Pyxis and UMB SSL authentication, the two were split into
    their own keys. The `request-and-upload-signature` task already had separate parameters for them, but
    they were using the same values
    * While it did have separate parameters for them, one set was prefixed `pyxis_` and the other had no
      prefix, so the prefix was added for the `umb_` ones
