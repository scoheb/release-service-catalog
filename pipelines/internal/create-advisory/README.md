# create-advisory pipeline

Tekton pipeline to execute the create-advisory task. The task clones the advisory repo, gets an ID for the advisory,
generates an advisory, then pushes it if the generated advisory is valid. The pipeline returns a result with the
advisory URL as well as a result to show the error message if one occurred.
